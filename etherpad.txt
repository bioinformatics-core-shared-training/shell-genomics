We will be teaching material from the Data Carpentry course:

Introduction to the Command Line for Genomics (but the lessons will apply to most command-line usage)

Please enter any questions below and we will endeavour to address them between lectures. Many thanks.

Shell
====

Anatomy of a linux command i.e.

command -flags <parameters>.  e.g. ls -al training/

man 'command' to find out what these can be for a given command

cd - change directory

pwd - print working directory

cd .. is change directory one level 'up'

cd ~ will take you to your home/login directory

full paths /a/b/c/d is an explicit path to a specific directory whereas if we are ar a/b then  c/d is a relative directory from there.


The wildcard * can be substituted for part of a filename to filter what a command uses e.g. ls fred* lists all files starting with fred

Forgotten which commands you have used - history command is your friend.  Up and down arrow keys will cycle through elements of your history.

cat concatenate file command is to output contents of file(s) and later we will show you how to put the output of this to a new file

less is useful to interactively view a file a page at a time or search with /

head and tail list top 10 lines or bottom 10 lines of a file

cp command copies files from one place to another

mkdir makes  new directories

mv is a command to move files from a source to a destination (or to rename a file)

We can use ls -l to find out the permissions on a file (who can do what to it) we use the chmod command to set the permissions

We use rm to remove files (delete them IF we are permitted to)


grep - your new best friend when searching through the contents of files

redirection e.g. > lets us send the output of one command into a file >> appends to an existing file

wc counts words, lines and characters in a file use a flag to select only one e.g. wc -l file

cut lets us pull columns out of a tabular file

sort orders whatever it gets as an input uniq filters to give you distinct items in the input e.g. how many  different trypes of fruit not how many of each type


nano text editor for mortals to create text files

Others exist e.g. sublime, atom

We can use a text editor to create our scripts. Theses enable us to automate tasks that run more than once e.g. thousands of times

If you call your scripts .sh this helps you remember that it is a shell script. We run our scripts by typing e.g.  bash script.sh

shell variables when output have a $ in it e.g. $name


Use meaningful names for your files and directories (so in 6 months time you know whats in them)

Structure your directories e.g. raw data, data, outputs, scripts etc this will help to protect you from outputting things into the top level and making a mess

This also helps with reproducibility of your analysis

If you are CRUK-CI based and plan to use the cluster to do computationally intensive tasks in Linux then this course (This Friday) will be relevant:

Site for you to practice/revise your command line skills http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=kp9lx7qdss

A linux cheatsheet https://github.com/bioinformatics-core-shared-training/2018-11-13-shell/blob/gh-pages/unixref.pdf You can find

more examples with a Google search

If you use Windows 10 and want to work through this material it is possible to install a bash linux environment under Windows
